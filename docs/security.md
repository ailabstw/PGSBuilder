# Data Security

A wide array of security measures are in force to ensure data privacy and security:

- Our server has ISO 27001 certification for implementing an information security management system (ISMS)

- Our server is designed based on the express MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework that encapsulates our features surrounded by powerful security layers

- The complete interaction with the server is secured with HTTPS

- The data you upload will be automatically deleted by the system after the analysis is completed, and we will not keep any data uploaded by users

- All analyzed results are encrypted with a firm one-time password and only the data uploader can access the report via an encrypted connection to get results back within 14 days
